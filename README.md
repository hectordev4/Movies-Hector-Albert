# HAMD — Movie Sanctuary by Héctor & Albert

HAMD is a modern, responsive cinephile web application built with Angular, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The platform allows users to explore trending and top-rated movies, discover popular directors and TV series, perform advanced multi-criteria searches, inspect detailed film and cast information, rate titles, save entries to their personal sanctuary, and check community rankings.

---

## How the app works

The application is structured around an intuitive entertainment portal that integrates:

- A persistent **navigation header** with real-time search and profile shortcuts.
- A dynamic **featured hero carousel** for trending titles.
- Curated carousels for **Top Rated Movies** and **Most Recent Releases**.
- Dedicated showcases for **Popular Directors** and **Top Rated TV Series**.
- A **detailed movie overview page** including full synopsis, metadata, action buttons, and cast credits.
- An **advanced movie search and filtering engine**.
- A **community rankings** leaderboard tracking top-voted titles.
- An **actor profile page** featuring biographic data and filmographies.
- A personalized **user sanctuary** to manage favorites, rated items, and watchlists, alongside an **edit profile modal**.

### User flow

1. The user lands on the home dashboard, greeted by trending cinema highlights in the hero carousel.
2. They can explore curated sections for top movies, new releases, acclaimed directors, and popular TV series.
3. Users can search directly from the header or access the dedicated search page to filter titles by genre, sort order, and rating.
4. Clicking any movie opens its detailed view to read the synopsis, check the cast, rate the title, or save it to "Favorites" or "Watch Later".
5. Selecting an actor or director opens their profile, detailing their biography and career highlights.
6. Users can navigate to the community rankings page to see what films are trending among peers or visit their private profile sanctuary to manage their saved lists and account details.
